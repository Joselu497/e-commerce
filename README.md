# e-commerce

## Description

E-commerce application implementing core features: product catalog, shopping cart, and user authentication. Consumes the Fake Store API (`https://fakestoreapi.com/products`) to mimic real e-commerce functionality.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Joselu497/e-commerce.git`

Install dependencies: 
`yarn install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Authentication
To test all application functionalities (shopping cart and payment), you need to authenticate using one of the following test users:
